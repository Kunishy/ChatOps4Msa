  title: hotel-reservation-microservices Microservices System
  description: |
    This is the Hotel Reservation Microservices Demo System, composed of modular services such as API gateway, authentication, customer management, room service, and notifications. Each service mimics a key functionality in a real-world hotel reservation platform. The system is structured for independent deployment, scanned via SonarQube, and managed in version-controlled GitHub repositories.
